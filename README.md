# Recipe Page

This is a custom-built recipe page developed from scratch using **HTML** and **CSS**. While the project idea was inspired by Frontend Mentor's Recipe Page challenge, the entire design and codebase were independently created to practice building responsive web components and mastering layout techniques.

> 💡 No AI was used in the development of this project. AI tools were utilized solely for documentation purposes, such as generating this README. I believe in building a strong foundation in programming while also learning how to effectively use AI tools as part of a modern developer workflow.

## ✨ Overview

Live Demo: [https://denilson15.github.io/recipe-page/](https://denilson15.github.io/recipe-page/)

This project showcases a functional recipe page that includes:

- A featured image of the dish
- A recipe title and description
- Preparation time, cooking time, and servings information
- A list of ingredients and step-by-step instructions
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices

## ⚙️ How It Works

- The HTML structure defines the layout of the recipe page, including sections for the image, title, description, preparation details, ingredients, and instructions.
- CSS is used to style the page, including layout, colors, typography, and spacing, ensuring a clean and professional appearance.
- The project is structured to be easily expandable for future development.

## 🛠️ Personalization

Although the initial concept was provided by Frontend Mentor, the following customizations were implemented:

- Designed and styled the layout from scratch using CSS
- Implemented responsive design techniques to ensure compatibility across devices
- Structured the HTML for semantic clarity and accessibility

## 🚧 Planned Updates

- Add interactive elements such as a print button or share functionality
- Implement dark mode with CSS variables
- Enhance layout for tablet/desktop view with additional styling

## 🗂️ File Structure (basic)

- `index.html` – Main structure of the webpage
- `styles.css` – Styling for layout and design
- `assets/` – Folder containing image assets used in the project

## ⚙️ Getting Started
